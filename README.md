# ðŸ“ˆðŸ§ª Data Analytics Program ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š : Story of Kwame Ofosu-Dapaah Asenso-Okyere

## Let me introduce Myself
After completing my tertiary education, I embarked on a career in business development for an energy efficiency company. In this role, I specialized in identifying prospective clients and engaging them by relying on the analysis conducted by another team. It was a very interesting experience as all the engagements were unique and brought about varying results.

## How would I describe my experience in the data analytics program ?Â 
It's been a fulfilling journey. I always found Data Analytics interesting and I finally got the opportunity to follow a well-thought out plan towards achieving that. Overall I would say it has been a rewarding experience.

## How would I say the Career Accelerator phase has introduced me to when it comes to data analytics ?Â 
The Career Accelerator phase introduced me to the expectations of the real-world in Data Analytics. I got a sense of the pressure to produce deliverables for team members who were depending on it and also waiting for deliverables from team members. Again, I learned about the need to tell coherent data stories through the results of my analysis and also offer value to the clients(in this case tutors).

## What enticed me to join the Data Analytics Program?
The clear path towards attaining the credentials of a Data Analyst.

## What would I say my progress in tech has been since joining the program ?Â 
My progress has been very quick. The needs of program were such that I had to quickly pick up concepts and understand what certain terms were and what they were in practical terms as well.

## What are my plans for the future 
I would like to gain more experience in data analytics especially in areas such as data transformation. Going throught the program made me realize that I have an interest in understanding what the client's needs are and engineering the already existing data  to create features that enable me to answer the questions. I have also developed an interest in dashboards and I look forward to creating dashboards with live data.

## What is my dream company or role ?
Business analyst
